# WhatLiesWithin

What Lies Within is an overhaul mod that focuses on new underground layers of the planet Nauvis. With each new underground layer comes new challenges and rewards. Do you have what it takes to find out exactly What Lies Within?

If you have any questions/comments/suggestions/concerns feel free to join my discord: https://discord.gg/G79WsJhETu or alternatively feel free to reach out to me personally on Discord at Niknoc#8830

Thanks for playing!!!

## Current Features:
- Underground layers! Build an Item Elevator and venture down into the planet. Who knows what's down there?
- New Ores: Tin, Lead, Silver, Gold, and Platinum
- New enemies and enemy behavior!
- Material packing and unpacking: Turn 5 plates into 1 ingot, 5 ingots into 1 sheet, and 5 sheets into 1 block. Now your trains can carry 125x as much as they could before!
- Molten versions of resources: Melt resources into liquids for a new way to transport and work with them.
- Updated recipes for vanilla items.

## Frequently Asked Questions:
- Why is Iron red?
  - I wanted it to look more rusty but also be easily distinguishable from copper. Also I'm colorblind.

- Can I play without biters?
  - Currently, no. You can disable them on the default surface (Nauvis) but they will still spawn underground.

- Does this mod work with X mod?
  - What Lies Within should play nice with most mods that aren't overhaul mods. Any mod that makes use of linked chests is likely to cause issues, and most other overhaul mods are currently incompatible (although I would like to fix this in the future).

- How can I contact you?
  - The best place to reach me is on Discord. My username is Niknoc#8830 if you'd like to send me a DM, or you can join my server at this link: https://discord.gg/q3tSrs3uRy

# **WARNING: EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT ARE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AVOID SPOILERS, TURN BACK NOW!!!**

## Short term plans:
- Finish implementing new recipes for vanilla items.
- Implement Boring Drills.
- Add lava seeps (vanilla oil patches, but for lava/magma).

## Long term plans:
- Implement the story (no spoilers hehe).
- Implement original graphics to replace current graphics (which are just vanilla graphics with their hues/saturations modified).
- Separate features that people might like to play with as standalone mods (like I already did with Angry Biters).
- Fix compatibility with Space Exploration, Krastorio2, and other big overhaul mods.
- Decide how machines that run on heat will work.
- Add underground lakes of oil that can be pumped out of with special offshore pumps.
- Add underground lava lakes that can be pumped out of with special offshore pumps.
